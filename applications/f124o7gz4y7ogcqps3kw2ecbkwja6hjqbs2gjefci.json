This is our first attempt in the Filecoin ecosystem.\n\nThe specific methods for data preparation are as follows:\n\nData Collection:\nCollect raw data from the source to ensure data integrity and accuracy.\nData Cleaning:\nUse Python's Pandas library and OpenRefine to handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.\nData Transformation:\nConvert data into storage-friendly formats such as CSV, JSON, and Parquet.\nData Sharding:\nShard large files for distributed storage to ensure efficient data management and retrieval.\nTools:\nCommonly used tools include Python, Apache Spark, and Hadoop.\n",
