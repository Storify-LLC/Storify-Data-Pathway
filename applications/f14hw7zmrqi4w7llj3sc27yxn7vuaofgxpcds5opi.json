    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The sixth phase of global coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model ensemble.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains two S3 bucket:\r\narn:aws:s3:::esgf-world    671.7 TiB\r\narn:aws:s3:::cmip6-pds    1.0 PiB",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "No response",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://registry.opendata.aws/cmip6/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Sporadic",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, Australia (continent), Antarctica",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03151449\r\nf1315096 \r\nf03055005 \r\nf03055018 \r\nf03055029\r\nf01518369\r\nf01889668\r\nf03151456\r\nf03179572\r\nf03214937\r\nf03178144\r\nf03178077\r\nf01106668 \r\nf0870558 \r\nf03151449\r\nf03151456",
