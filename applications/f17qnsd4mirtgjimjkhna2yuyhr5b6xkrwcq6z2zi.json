    "Brief history of your project and organization": "MOVVA Tech, founded in 2018 and headquartered in Shanghai, specializes in AI+CG virtual technology.\n\nLed by Dr. Chai Jinxiang, the company brings together top global talent in computer vision and graphics.\n\nIts core technology offers full-stack virtual human solutions, including modeling, animation, and AI-driven interaction.\n\nAI-powered motion capture cuts costs by 90% while automating facial/body animations.\n\nIt provides high-fidelity virtual avatars for industries like e-commerce, education, and finance.\n\nMOVVAâ€™s virtual live-streaming tools enable real-time multilingual interactions for digital marketing.\n\nIts patented tech has won awards like ACM SIGGRAPH and holds dozens of IP rights.\n\nBacked by investors (e.g., Sequoia China, Morningside), it raised $130M in Series B funding.\n\nPartners include Tencent and ByteDance, scaling metaverse content production.\n\nMOVVA aims to build foundational infrastructure for seamless virtual-real integration.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The data stored by MOVVA Tech on the Filecoin network primarily includes:\n\nHigh-precision 3D virtual human model data (including topology structures, texture maps, skeletal rigging, and other engineering files);\n\nMassive motion capture raw data (containing sequential data such as facial expression captures and limb movement trajectories);\n\nAI training datasets (comprising labeled motion sequences and rendered samples generated by computer vision algorithms).",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "MOVVA Tech's data processing pipeline covers 3D scanning acquisition, cleaning & labeling, format standardization, and version control, ultimately storing categorized data on the Filecoin network while generating metadata indexes.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://www.xmov.ai/case",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "More than 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America, Europe, Australia (continent), Antarctica",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with.
